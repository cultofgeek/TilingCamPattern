TilingCamPattern
================

A Flash project to create a stylized version of the user's webcam video input.

This little project was inspired by the old Razorfish website which featured a live webcam feed that became stylized into an artful series of fluid pixels.

The project is very simple.  It takes the user's webcam feed samples the colors and applies that color to tiling pattern on the stage.  

This script can probably be easily adapted to HTML5 and Javascript.
